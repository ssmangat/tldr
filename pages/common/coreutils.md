# coreutils

> Uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in Rust Language.
> Uutils includes a multi-call binary from which the utils can be invoked. This reduces the binary size of the binary and can be useful for portability.
> The first argument of the multi-call binary is the util to run, after which the regular arguments to the util can be passed.
> More information: <https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/multicall.html>.
